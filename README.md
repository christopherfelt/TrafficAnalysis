Urban and Rural Traffic Trends on I84 in Idaho


In this paper, I compare average daily traffic for urban and rural areas along Interstate 84 (I-84) in Idaho.  In particular, I investigate the difference in average daily traffic for four sites.  Two sites, Site 1 and Site 2, are urban and are located near Boise, the largest population center in Idaho.  The other two sites, Site 3 and Site 4, are rural and located near Twin Falls and Declo respectfully. This research uses data from the Idaho Transportation Department’s (ITD) automatic traffic recorders (ATR) website and its Average Annual Daily Traffic (AADT) shapefile. Analysis of this data shows that Site 1, Site 2 and Site 4 have upward trends in daily traffic. Site 3’s trend line is flat up to 2012 and then inclines indicating an increase in daily traffic. Projections for each site suggests that daily traffic at Site 1, Site 2 and Site 4 will continue to increase.
